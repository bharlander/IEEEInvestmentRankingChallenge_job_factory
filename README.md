Then you need to define a class for your challenge similar to `kit_energy_evaluator.py`
The simplest definition can be :
```
import pandas as pd
class ExampleEvaluator:
  def __init__(self, answer_file_path):
    self.answer_file_path = answer_file_path

  def _evaluate(self, submission_file_path):
    submission = pd.read_csv("submission_file_path")

    """
    Do something with your submitted file to come up
    with a score and a secondary score.

    if you want to report back an error to the user,
    then you can simply do :
      `raise Exception("YOUR-CUSTOM-ERROR")`
    """
    _result_object = {
        "score": np.random.random(),
        "score_secondary" : np.random.random()
    }
    return _result_object
```
